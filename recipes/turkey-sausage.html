        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This homemade turkey sausage is flavored with sage, marjoram, and a bit of red pepper, with no preservatives. Freeze the patties individually to store and cook throughout the week.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried sage</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground turkey</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix sage, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and marjoram together in a small bowl. Place turkey into a large bowl and mix in spice mixture with your hands until well combined. Form into 10 patties.</li>
            <li>Cook patties in batches in a large skillet over medium-high heat until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
